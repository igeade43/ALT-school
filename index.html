        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Ige Hakeem is an ambitious and detail-oriented engineering graduate
          with a strong passion for technology, innovation, and problem-solving.
          I holds a first-class degree in Material and Metallurgical
          Engineering<br />
          from the prestigous University of Ilorin, where I developed expertise
          in materials science, corrosion prevention, manufacturing
          applications, and basics in programming in languages like python, C+,
          Javascript,<br />
          Fortran, and Matlab. My academic journey has been marked by rigorous
          research, particularly in using nanomaterials as corrosion inhibitors
          for mild steel.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond academia, I have gained practical experience in various fields,
          including data analysis, virtual assistance, and business research. My
          recent work in the short-term rental industry involved market
          analysis<br />
          and optimization strategies for Airbnb / Vacation Rental hosts one of
          whivh include giving out free product to host to improve customer
          experience. Additionally, My proficiency in lead generation, STR
          research/<br />arbitrage, email management, data entry and other
          administrative task highlights my ability to navigate digital tools
          and business operations effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my leisure time, I enjoy singing- though my voice is not that good,
          I still flow with the likes of BurnaBoy and Wizkid and my style of
          music always depend on my mood; watching football- my favourite team
          is<br />
          Liverpool FC (YNWA) though they frustrate me with their kick and
          follow pattern of play, cooking, exploring nature, and trying new
          things.
          <br />These activities help him stay creative, balanced, and open to
          new experiences.

        <h2>Why I Joined ALTSchool Africa</h2>
        <p>
          I joined ALTSchool Africa to bridge the gap between my engineering
          background and the rapidly evolving field of technology. Recognizing
          the increasing role of software and data-driven solutions in
          engineering,
          <br />he sought structured training in front-end development, computer
          science, and software engineering principles. ALTSchool Africa's
          hands-on approach and industry-relevant curriculum align with his goal
          of<br />
          becoming a versatile and skilled technology professional.
